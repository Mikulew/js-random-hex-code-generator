## General info

Hex color codes are **values that tell the display how much of a color to show**. The values are a special code that represents color values from 0 to 255. If red, green, and blue are all at the minimum 0 (represented as "00" in the code), the color expressed is the color black.

A color hex code is **a hexadecimal way to represent a color in RGB format by combining three values** â€“ the amounts of *red*, *green* and *blue* in a particular shade of color.

These color hex codes have been an integral part of HTML for web design, and remain a key way of representing color formats digitally.
